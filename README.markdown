# LG TV RS232 Control via CommandFusion 

   Developed by Darren Vollmer
   Additional coding by Jarrod Bell

## Overview

This project allows for control of LG TV's via RS232 using CommandFusion software and any Serial to Ethernet converter.

There are two examples for LG TV control:

1. Uses basic feedback processing and commands, but is not a complete implementation of the LG Protocol.
2. Uses JavaScript, coded by Darren Vollmer, and is a complete implementation.

Use whichever you are more comfortable with, and whichever suits your needs.

## Advanced JavaScript Version

Included is a JavaScript file for iViewer that handles all the RS232 communication with the TV.

To go along with the JavaScript file, there is also a sample iViewer project.  
This project should be used as a reference on how to call the JavaScript functions in your own project and how to setup the System Properties.
