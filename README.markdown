# LG TV RS232 Control via CommandFusion 

## Overview
This project allows for control of LG TV's via RS232 using CommandFusion software and any Serial to Ethernet converter.

The project is split into 3 parts:

1. [iViewer JavaScript file](#js)
1. [CF iViewer Project](#iviewer)

### <a name="js" />iViewer JavaScript File
We have developed a JavaScript file for iViewer that handles all the RS232 communication with the TV.

### <a name="iviewer" />CF iViewer Project
To go along with the [JavaScript file](#js), we have created a sample iViewer project.  
This project should be used as a reference on how to call the JavaScript functions in your own project and how to setup the System Properties.
